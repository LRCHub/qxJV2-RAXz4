I'm a working alien in a land of heat and stone
A casulaty of an economic war
That took me away from home.
It's the politics of money and power
It's the hope that we can build a future in world
Getting smaller everywhere

I can hear a siren in the workyard
Another shift and I'll be closer to you
I'm a working dog in Babylon and only
Your love can get me through

Foreign nights -- took you away from me
Foreign nights -- are not where I belong
Foreign nights -- filled with dust and dreams
Foreign nights -- trapped me in Babylon

AS long as I keep moving
I know I will be all right
Cause if I stop to think I'll drown and sink
In the sea of foreign nights
I've got to keep my hands busy
Got to keep pushing through
Got to learn to deal with this time away from you

I can hear a siren in the workyard
Another shift and I'll be closer to you
I'm a working dog in Babylon and only
Your love can get me through

Foreign nights -- took you away from me
Foreign nights -- are not where I belong
Foreign nights -- filled with dust and dreams
Foreign nights -- trapped me in Babylon

Quiet moments in the dark are hardest to face
The sun goes down but not the pain
I want to be with you all the time
I want to be with you, to be with you all my life
I'm going to have to get through... foreign nights.
